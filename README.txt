   Change Log:        2016-Aug-26 - Version 1.0 release.

Directory structure:
	../AEC Portal/        - top level directory, contains the main executable
                            load_portal.bat file and this README.
	../code/              - contains code and log file for the grader system.
	../html/		- web portal code.
	../output_data/       - directory were files generated by main executables
	                        will be stored. 
                             (empty_dir.txt can be removed after install.)
	../input_data/        - directory where files to be analysed are located.
                             (if present, test *.csv files can be removed
                             after install.)


AEC Portal Install:
	1. Extract the zip file into the directory of your choice.
		(Suggestion is to use C:\ATSRI-Code\ as the default top level
        directory.)
	2. Ensure the directory structure is maintained.
	3. Delete ../output_data/empty_dir.txt. 
		(This file is only included to maintain directory structure in the
        archive.)
	4. Download PHP (Version > 5.6.20) http://windows.php.net/download 
		Select a PHP Non-Thread-Safe version that matches your processor. 
		Download the .zip file. (you can skip the debug pack)
	5. Extract the files from the .zip file to someplace like 
        'C:\ATSRI-Code\PHP-5.6.20'
	6. Adjust your system's path 
	   (in Win10 Control Panel > System > System Properties > Advanced >
        Environment Variables...)
	   (in Win7 Control Panel > System and Security > System > 
        Advanced System Settings > Environment Variables...)
	7. Under System Variables find the variable named "path", highlight it and
        click edit.
	8. Under Variable value, add ";C:\ATSRI-Code\PHP-5.6.20" to the end. 
		** or wherever the files are where you put php.exe in step 5.
	9. Go into C:\ATSRI-Code\PHP-5.6.20 *** or wherever you put the php files
        in the previous step *** and look for 'php.ini-development' rename it
        to 'php.ini'
	10. Use Notepad to modify line ~714 (;include_path = ".;c:\php\includes")
         in ../php/php.ini to match the directory from step 1 and step 2. Also
		 remove the ';' at the start of line ~714. Save and close this file.
		 (Example: include_path = ".;C:\ATSRI-Code\PHP-5.6.20\extras\")
	11. Open a command prompt window.
		 (<windows key> + <R>, cmd.exe, <ENTER>)
	12. Type 'CD directory\from\step\1\DCMS Grades' and press <ENTER>
		 (Example: 'cd C:\ATSRI-Code\AEC Portal')
	13. If the command prompt window does not change to refelect the directory
         in step 12, enter the drive letter from that path and press enter.
		(Example: 'C:')
	14. Run load_portal.bat
		(In the command prompt window, type 'load_portal' then press <ENTER>)
	15. Verify no errors are returned.
	16. Check output files in ../output_data/
	17. If steps 14 & 15 are satisfactory, remove all files from
	     ../output_data/ and ../input_data/
