# Event Adjudication Committee Jury Room (EAC-Jury Room)
Event Adjudication Committee - Jury Room

Project: Web-based jury portal built for the DO-Touch.NET Practice-Based Research Network's Event Adjudication Committee. This project is designed to assist investigators with determining what patient-reported events are adverse events by consensus of review committee members. The raw dataset is parsed from a CSV file generated by a separate survey generator and moved into a MySQL database. The committee members log into a web-based portal where each event identified as potentially adverse can be reviewed and voted upon until the committee reaches a consensus.
